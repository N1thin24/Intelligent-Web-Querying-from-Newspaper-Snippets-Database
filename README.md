# Intelligent-Web-Querying-from-Newspaper-Snippets-Database

The "Intelligent Web Querying from Newspaper Snippets Database" project is designed to streamline the process of extracting and querying information from a vast database of newspaper snippets. Utilizing advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, this tool enables users to perform precise searches and obtain relevant information quickly and efficiently.

Features
Automated Snippet Extraction: Automatically extracts snippets from digital newspaper archives.
Intelligent Query Processing: Employs NLP techniques to understand and process user queries in natural language.
Advanced Search Capabilities: Supports complex queries, including Boolean operations and fuzzy matching.


After setting up the project and starting the web application, you will be presented with options to perform different types of searches and choose how the results are ranked based on their relevance to your query.

Choosing Your Query Type
When you initiate a search, the application will prompt you to select the type of query you wish to perform:
Simple Query: Allows you to search for single or multiple keywords across the database.
Phrase Query: Enables searching for exact phrases or sequences of words in the database, ensuring the words appear together in the same order.
Wildcard Query: Offers the ability to use wildcard characters (e.g., *, ?) to match a variety of word forms or spellings.

Choosing Your Ranking Type
After selecting your query type, you will then choose how the search results should be ranked according to their relevance:
Cosine Similarity: Ranks results based on the cosine similarity between the query and document vectors, favoring documents that are directionally similar to the query in the multidimensional space.
Summation of tf-idf scores w.r.t document: Utilizes the sum of term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) scores for each term in the document, emphasizing documents with high term relevance.
Summation of (tf-idf w.r.t doc * tf-idf w.r.t query): Employs a combined measure that accounts for the tf-idf scores of terms in both the document and the query, prioritizing documents that are relevant to the specific terms of the query.
